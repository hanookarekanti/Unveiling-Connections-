# 📖 GitaGraph: Unveiling Connections in the Bhagavad Gita with NLP and Graph Neural Networks
## 📌 Overview

**GitaGraph** is an NLP + Graph AI-based project that extracts, models, and predicts character relationships from the *Bhagavad Gita* using techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction, and Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCN).

It bridges spiritual literature and artificial intelligence, offering an interactive and analyzable view of divine and human relationships in the epic.
